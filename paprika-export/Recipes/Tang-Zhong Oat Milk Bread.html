            <p class="line"># 1 ) Cook Tang-Zhong/ In a saucepan, whisk together flour and water/milk. Cook over medium heat and keep whisking until the consistency is thick or reaches 65°C / 149°F. Cooldown to room temperature before incorporating it into the recipe.</p><p class="line"># 2 ) Mx the Bread Dough / In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients. Draw a well at the center and add in all wet ingredients except the oil. Start mixing from the center with your hands or a stand mixer.</p><p class="line">Keep mixing and kneading until a dough is formed. Add in oil and continue kneading until it is fully incorporated. Continue to knead or mix until you have a smooth and non-sticky dough. This takes about 10-15 minutes.</p><p class="line"># 3 ) First Proof / Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover it with a warm towel, or leave it in a proofing oven for 2 hours or until the dough doubles its size.</p><p class="line"># 4 ) Shape the Dough / After the first proof, dust a little flour on your hand and the work surface, and scrape the dough on the work surface.</p><p class="line">Lightly roll or punch the dough to release the extra air in the dough. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Lightly knead them into round shapes, cover with a warm towel and let them rise for another 20 minutes.</p><p class="line">Roll each dough into a flat oval shape, fold the two long edges in, and roll from the top. Tuck the edges so the dough stays in shape. Repeat for the rest of the doughs.</p><p class="line"># 5 ) Second Proof / Transfer the rolled dough to a baking pan. Cover it with a warm towel and let it rise for another 60-90 minutes or until they double in size.</p><p class="line"># 6 ) Bake / Preheat the oven to 350°F /176°C. Brush a light layer of maple syrup on the dough to help with browning. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until it turns golden.</p><p class="line"># 7 ) Serve &amp; Store / Remove it from the baking pan once out of the oven. Let the bread rest on a rack for at least 10 minutes before serving.</p><p class="line">Tang-zhong</p><p class="line">In a saucepan, whisk together flour and water/milk.</p><p class="line">Heat over medium heat and keep whisking until the consistency is thick enough to draw an &quot;8&quot; or reaches 65°C / 149°F.</p><p class="line">Cooldown to room temperature before incorporating it into the recipe.</p><p class="line">Bread Dough</p><p class="line">In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients.

            <p>A warm environment allows the dough to rise more and better.</p><p>If you don’t have a proof draw, you can cover the dough with a warm towel and leave it in a microwave or oven; don’t open the door during the rise.</p><p>Alternatively, microwave a bowl/cup of water, and leave the dough inside. This creates a warm and uniform environment for the rise.</p>
